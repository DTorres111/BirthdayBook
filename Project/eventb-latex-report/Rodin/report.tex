\hl{Prepare the documentation for the assignment and the project professionally.}

Rodin produces Latex documentation, so this is a good method for documenting your specifications and refinements. See \url{https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/project/sel-students/p:tutorials:latex:start} for an introduction to Latex. Login at the bottom with your Prism login.

\section{Initial model, first and second refinement}

The initial model, and first and second refinement are as in the textbook. The initial model is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:m0}.

An image of all the proofs successfully discharged for the initial model is provided below:

\hl{Student: the above is just to help you structure your document in Latex. You must document the complete specification and refinement including contexts, machines and any E and R descriptions. Explain in the text the idea behind each refinement}
